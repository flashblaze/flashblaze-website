_Disclaimer: This is not a technical post but rather an "overview" of stuff I did in April. I'll be uploading posts like these once in a while to share stuff in general._

Still here? Cool. Let's go.

This post will be broken into three parts:

1. _Zero to One_
2. _Stasis_
3. _Conclusion_

<br />

## _Zero to One_

April was an eventful month for me and was primarily the reason for writing this post.

I worked on a music video for [Aseem Dhaneshwar](https://instagram.com/aseemdmusic) along with [Aseem Kurhekar](https://instagram.com/zariya.music) called _Ilaaj_ for his deput ep. You can check the video linked below.

<br />

It was a lot of fun to work on this video and I learned a ton of stuff. 95% of the video is done in After Effects while the remaining 5% was done in Blender.

I also began reading two books:

- [Masters of Doom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222146.Masters_of_Doom)
- [Digital Harmony: On the Complementarity of Music and Visual Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2794378-digital-harmony)

While I was able to complete _Masters of Doom_, the same cannot be said for _Digital Harmony_. With the completion of one book, I have now read 4 books till now. And I hope to complete my resolution of reading at least 12 books this year. I keep track of the books using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11887441-neeraj).

I was always interested in audio and visual arts and to further explore this area, I'm now learning two new tools

- [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome)

_Processing_ is an open-source graphical library used to create visuals, while _TidalCycles_ is an open-source language/software for live coding music. I'm documenting my progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/FlashBlaze/experiments). I'm also now using `mdx` instead of `md` to include React components here. The above embedded video is an example of that.

<br />

## Stasis

It was not all roses though. As I mentioned before, I started reading two books with the intention of completing both while I was able to complete only one.

I also planned on improving my [HackerNews Reader](https://github.com/FlashBlaze/ycnews) app but I failed to do so. The same goes for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKfDFA1cCAB1Oq5B6Vr7ew) as I wasn't able to upload a single video. Another thing was this website's redesign. While I moved from `md` to `mdx`, I was not able to completely redesign it which I hope to do in this month.

<br />

## Conclusion

In retrospect I know I was taking a lot on my plate, but mostly it was poor time management on my part. I hope I'll be able to accomplish more this month as I'm going to use some task planners to help me manage my time efficiently (hopefully).

I have looked into [Notion](https://notion.so), [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org) along with some other alternatives and I'll see how it goes.

Stay home and wash your hands :house: :potable_water:
